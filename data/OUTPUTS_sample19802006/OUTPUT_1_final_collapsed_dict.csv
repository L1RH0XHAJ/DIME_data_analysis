real_data,"Because we balance the panel data (i.e., have every cycle for each district), this dummy is used to indicate whether the district-cycle existed (value: 1) or not (value: 0). For the sake of this research, we consider a district to exist in cycles when elections are held. We create the dummy when merging the grouped-by district and cycle contribution-level dataset (depending on the variables, either OUTPUT_2, OUTPUT_3, OUTPUT_4, or OUTPUT_8) with a dataset that contains all district and cycle combinations that were either created or discontinued after 1980 (new_districts_filtered.csv), since every DIME contribution comes after this election year. If the district-cycle was created before 1980 and has no discontinuation year, it implies the district's persistent existence in our period of interest (i.e., 1980 to 2024), meaning that the district will always receive 1 and we don't have to deal with this. If a district-cycle was either created or discontinued or both after 1980, then this district-cycle receives 1 if the cycle is between the district's creation and discontinuation year, while it receives 0 if the cycle is before the district's creation year or later than the district's discontinuation year.
