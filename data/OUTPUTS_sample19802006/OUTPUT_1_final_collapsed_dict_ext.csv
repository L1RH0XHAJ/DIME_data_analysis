treat_1,"First dummy we use to measure the impact of the death of an incumbent on contributions. For single death districts, we assign values of 0 before death of the incumbent, 1 at the district-cycle when the first (and only) death occurs and all following cycles. For multiple death districts, we assume the first death is the only death, hence the same logic is repeated. Otherwise, variable will always have zero values if districts are not part of the treatment (i.e., has never experienced the death of an incumbent).",Author (from merged datasets),"contribDB_1980.csv to contribDB_2024.csv ; dime_recipients_1979_2024.csv ; special_elections_final.csv, election_dates.csv",https://data.stanford.edu/dime ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_special_elections_to_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives,OUTPUT_7 (Entity-time variables)
treat_2,"Second dummy we use to measure the impact of the death of an incumbent on contributions. For single death districts, we repeat the logic we used for these districts in treat_1. For multiple death districts, we assign 0 to all cycles coming before the first death of an incumbent in that district's history, 1 at the district-cycle when the first death occurs. In the new election cycle the values are set back to 0, and only assigned 1 again at the following death. This is repeated for the second death, and all other deaths.

For single death districts, we assign 0 to all cycles coming before the first (only) death of an incumbent in that district's history, 1 at the district-cycle when the first (only) death occurs.

real_data,"Because we balance the panel data (i.e., have every cycle for each district), this dummy is used to indicate whether the district-cycle existed (value: 1) or not (value: 0). For the sake of this research, we consider a district to exist in cycles when elections are held. We create the dummy when merging the grouped-by district and cycle contribution-level dataset (depending on the variables, either OUTPUT_2, OUTPUT_3, OUTPUT_4, or OUTPUT_8) with a dataset that contains all district and cycle combinations that were either created or discontinued after 1980 (new_districts_filtered.csv), since every DIME contribution comes after this election year. If the district-cycle was created before 1980 and has no discontinuation year, it implies the district's persistent existence in our period of interest (i.e., 1980 to 2024), meaning that the district will always receive 1 and we don't have to deal with this. If a district-cycle was either created or discontinued or both after 1980, then this district-cycle receives 1 if the cycle is between the district's creation and discontinuation year, while it receives 0 if the cycle is before the district's creation year or later than the district's discontinuation year. Missing values coming from 'fake districts' (real_data == 0) were replaced with zeros.",Wikipedia,new_districts.html; new_districts.csv; new_districts_filtered_universe.csv; new_districts_filtered_universe_party.csv,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_congressional_districts,"OUTPUT_2, OUTPUT_3, OUTPUT_4, OUTPUT_8 (Variables measured in or related to dollar amounts)"

_suffix,"For treated district-cycle observations, we apply condition that keeps only contributions coming between death date and date of special elections. Suffix determines what treatment we used to apply this condition (either treat_1, treat_2, or treat_3); No suffix indicates original variable (i.e. filtering condition not applied). For single-death district, condition applied similarly for all variables (_1, _2, _3) when first treatment occurs. In multiple-death districts, we apply condition for _1 variables only when first death occurs, for _2 and _3 variables we apply the condition when the death(s) occur(s) again.",(see original var),(see original var),(see original var),(see original var)
_gen_np,"For all variables that contain '_gen_' (meaning 'general elections'), in treated district-cycle observations, we apply condition that keeps contributions of general and special elections coming between death date and date of special elections; else, in untreated district-cycle we only keep general elections contributions. Treatment is defined by respective treatment variable: treat_1, treat_2, treat_3. For _1 variables, we consider a district-cycle row treated only for the first death (for both single-death and multiple-death districts). For _2 and _3, we treat all deaths. Therefore, in case of single-death districts, the first and only treated row will be identical for all _1, _2, _3 variable types. For multiple-death districts, they are only identical in the first death, otherwise they differ.",(see original var),(see original var),(see original var),(see original var)
_gen_np_spec,"Similar to _gen_np, for all variables that contain '_gen_', in treated district-cycle observations, we apply condition that keeps contributions of (only) special elections coming between death date and date of special elections; else, in untreated district-cycle we only keep general elections contributions. Treatment is defined the same way as for _gen_np variables.",(see original var),(see original var),(see original var),(see original var)
